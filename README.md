# ðŸ“§ Cold Mail Generator
The Cold Email Generator is an intelligent automation tool built using Groq, LangChain, and Streamlit. It allows users to provide the URL of a companyâ€™s careers page, from which it automatically scrapes job postings and generates personalized cold emails tailored to the job description. The system also links relevant portfolio projects, retrieved from a vector database (ChromaDB), to strengthen outreach. 

**Imagine a scenario:**

Suppose Nike is hiring a Principal Software Engineer. Instead of spending heavy resources on hiring and training, a software development company like Atliq can directly pitch services. Using this tool, Atliqâ€™s business development executive (say, Mohan) can generate a tailored cold email highlighting relevant expertise and portfolio linksâ€”within seconds.

**ðŸ”‘ Key Highlights**

Automated Job Scraping: Extracts job postings directly from company career pages.

Personalized Emails: Crafts role-specific cold emails enriched with portfolio links.

High Performance: Leveraging Groqâ€™s LPU inference engine, the system achieves 0.8 sec email latency, representing a 7Ã— speedup compared to standard LLM APIs.

Accuracy in Targeting: Evaluated with 78% precision and 88% recall for RAG retrieval, ensuring high-quality matching of portfolio content with job descriptions.

End-to-End Deployment: Delivered as a full-stack Streamlit application, seamlessly integrating multiple APIs into an efficient workflow.
